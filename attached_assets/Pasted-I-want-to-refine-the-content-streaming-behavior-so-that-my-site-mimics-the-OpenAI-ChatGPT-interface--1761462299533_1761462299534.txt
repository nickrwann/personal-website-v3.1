I want to refine the content streaming behavior so that my site mimics the OpenAI ChatGPT interface as closely as possible. Specifically, here’s what I need you to implement and optimize:

1. Streaming Behavior

On initial page load (URL load), stream the About Me and Experience sections into the UI character-by-character, similar to GPT’s output stream.

Both sections should be wrapped in a single parent container <div>, for example id="stream-container", so that future sections (like “Projects” or “Publications”) can also be added and streamed as a sequence.

The streaming should simulate conversational pacing — sentences should flow naturally, not instant bursts. Minor randomization of delay between characters is acceptable for realism.

Maintain smoothness and responsiveness. Scrolling, text animation, and other UI elements should not block or freeze while streaming is in progress.

2. Scroll Behavior

Do not auto-scroll the page downward as content streams in once the user has scrolled upward manually.

Instead, mimic ChatGPT’s “scroll-to-bottom” button behavior:

When the streaming content extends beyond the current viewport, show a small circular arrow button (bottom-right corner, similar to GPT).

Clicking this button should smoothly scroll the viewport to the bottom of the content.

The button should only appear when the page is not at the bottom and hide when the user is already at the bottom.

The scroll should be handled with smooth animation, not a jump.

3. Timing and Triggers

Begin streaming as soon as the page’s main React component mounts (no need to wait for user interaction).

Once all streaming finishes, trigger the Q&A / ChatInput section to fade in below the streamed content, matching the visual hierarchy GPT uses when presenting a new prompt box.

4. Performance and Responsiveness

Ensure that streaming logic doesn’t block layout shifts or break responsiveness on mobile devices.

The subtitle (“AI Systems Engineer & Creative Problem Solver”) should stay visually aligned and unaffected by the streaming.

Use IntersectionObserver or similar mechanisms to determine whether the user is near the bottom to conditionally show or hide the “scroll-to-bottom” button.

Add small easing transitions between new sections as they are revealed.

5. Edge-case Behavior

If the user reloads the page mid-stream, restart the streaming from the beginning (not partial state).

If the user resizes the window during streaming, maintain the streaming state and reflow text gracefully.

When all streaming is complete, ensure keyboard focus defaults to the Q&A input field.

In short, replicate the exact content flow feel of ChatGPT:

Text types out progressively.

Scrolling feels natural.

A “scroll to bottom” button appears when content extends past the view.

The chat input appears smoothly only after content finishes loading.

Make reasonable assumptions for timing, easing, and animation curves for the best possible UX.
