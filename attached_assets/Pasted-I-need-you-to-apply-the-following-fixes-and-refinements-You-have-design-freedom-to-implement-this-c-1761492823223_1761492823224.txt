I need you to apply the following fixes and refinements. You have design freedom to implement this cleanly with good UX, but all functional requirements below must be met.

1. Streaming speed

   * Increase the streaming pace globally to 1 character every 10 ms.
   * This applies to About Me, Experience descriptions, and chat responses.
   * Keep the inline blinking cursor behavior consistent everywhere.

2. Scroll to bottom button behavior

   * The scroll to bottom button is currently showing too early.
   * It should only appear if there is content below the current viewport.
   * Do not base this on “near the bottom” heuristics.
   * Use an approach like checking whether the bottom sentinel is below the visible window.
   * If all content fits in the viewport, or the user is already scrolled to the bottom, the button should not be visible.
   * When clicked, it should smooth scroll to the true bottom.

3. Mobile chat input positioning

   * On mobile, when the input bar is focused and the keyboard opens, the bar should move up just enough to sit on top of the keyboard and stay there.
   * Right now it briefly moves above the keyboard, then jumps to the top of the viewport. Remove that jump.
   * The bar should not scroll the whole page upward.
   * It should remain anchored just above the keyboard until the keyboard closes.

4. Suggestion prompt pills visibility

   * Do not hide the example prompt pills just because the textarea is focused.
   * The pills should remain visible while the user is typing.
   * The pills should only disappear after the user actually sends a message.
   * On page reload, the pills should be visible again.
   * If the chat is reset (see item 6), the pills should also reappear.

5. Reload chat button behavior

   * The reload/reset icon in the chat bar should NOT reload the entire page.
   * It should reset ONLY the chat component.
   * Reset means:

     * Clear the user’s asked question (if any)
     * Clear the model response (if any)
     * Return UI to initial “ready state”

6. Reset also restores suggestions

   * When the reload/reset button is used, the example prompt pills should reappear exactly like first load.

7. Spacing and padding

   * Fix the spacing around the chat bar and the pills so it looks intentional on both desktop and mobile.
   * No giant empty padding under the chat bar.
   * No overlapping or text squishing.
   * Make sure long pill text wraps cleanly across lines without blowing up layout.

8. General polish

   * Apply sensible UX decisions for animation timing, fade in/out, easing, etc.
   * The end result should feel stable, professional, and predictable.
   * Do not introduce layout jumps, forced scrolls, or flicker.

Deliverables

* Update components and hooks so that streaming is at 10 ms/char.
* Fix the scroll-to-bottom button logic and visibility rules.
* Fix the mobile keyboard adjustment logic so the chat bar stops jumping to the top of the viewport.
* Update suggestion pill lifecycle rules.
* Implement the chat reset behavior and tie it to the reload icon.
* Clean up padding and wrapping around the chat bar and pills for both desktop and mobile.
