I need you to completely remove all auto-scrolling behavior during and after streaming. The system should never automatically scroll the viewport — only the user or the scroll-to-bottom button should control movement.

Requirements

1. Remove Auto Scrolling

Disable all scrollIntoView, window.scrollTo, and similar logic that runs during streaming or at the end of it.

The viewport must remain fixed unless the user manually scrolls or clicks the scroll-to-bottom button.

The stream should happen passively in place — no forced scrolling whatsoever.

2. Scroll Button Behavior

Add (or fix) a circular down-arrow button centered horizontally at the bottom of the viewport (not pinned to the right).

It should only appear when:

There is content below the current viewport, regardless of streaming state.

The user has scrolled up (even slightly).

It should hide when:

The user is already at the bottom.

The content fits entirely within the viewport (no overflow).

3. Scroll Button Interaction

Clicking the button should smoothly scroll to the bottom of the page or container.

The button should remain visible until the viewport reaches the bottom.

Use a subtle fade-in / fade-out for visibility transitions to keep it elegant.

It must not flicker or repeatedly appear/disappear while the stream grows.

4. Implementation Details

Use an IntersectionObserver (or equivalent) to track whether the bottom element is in view.

When the bottom sentinel element (for example, #stream-end) is visible, hide the button.

When it’s out of view, show the button.

Do not tie this logic to the streaming lifecycle; it should work regardless of whether streaming is active or complete.

Make sure the button layer sits above the rest of the UI (for example, z-index: 50+).

5. Existing Elements

Keep the pulsing cursor exactly as it is — do not modify or remove it.

Keep all current streaming and content timing intact — just decouple scrolling logic from it.

Expected Result

When the site loads:

The About Me and Experience sections stream normally.

The viewport does not move.

If the streamed content extends beyond the current view, a circular down-arrow button appears centered at the bottom.

Clicking the button scrolls smoothly to the end of the stream.

If I scroll up after streaming finishes, the button reappears.

The button never flickers or vanishes prematurely.
