Use this as your next prompt to Replit, with no extra commentary:

I need you to refine the chat input area at the bottom of the page, especially on mobile. Apply these changes:
	1.	Input bar contents
1.1 Remove the mic button and the plus button entirely.
1.2 The row inside the input bar should now be:
- refresh icon on the left
- the textarea with placeholder text (Ask anything about Nick…)
- character counter (0/250)
- send button (paper airplane in a circular pill) on the right
1.3 All of these elements need to be vertically centered with each other in one single row.
1.4 The paper airplane icon and its circular button must be visually centered together. Right now they are slightly off. Fix that.
1.5 Make sure the character counter positioning looks intentional. You can choose final placement so that the layout does not feel lopsided on desktop or cramped on mobile. Use design judgment.
	2.	Desktop and page flow
2.1 Keep the input bar anchored to the bottom of the page content, not fixed to the viewport.
2.2 Do not make it follow scroll on desktop.
2.3 Reduce the bottom padding: the gap between the bottom of the webpage and the input bar is currently too large. Bring that gap down so the input bar visually feels like the footer of the page.
2.4 The suggestion prompt chips above the bar can stay stacked on mobile. That is acceptable.
	3.	Mobile keyboard behavior
3.1 When I tap into the textarea on mobile and the keyboard opens:
- The input bar should move up just enough to sit directly above the keyboard.
- It should not jump all the way toward the top of the viewport. That jump is wrong.
3.2 While I am typing, the bar should stay docked just above the keyboard. It should not keep sliding around as I interact.
3.3 If I scroll up while the keyboard is open, I want normal mobile behavior:
- The keyboard should dismiss automatically.
- After the keyboard dismisses, the input bar should snap back down to its normal resting position at the bottom of the page content.
3.4 I do not want a drag-follow effect. The bar should not float around with my finger. It should only ever be in one of two states:
- Resting at the bottom of the page (keyboard closed)
- Sitting directly above the keyboard (keyboard open and focused)
	4.	Scroll / viewport logic
4.1 Do not auto-scroll the whole page upward when I focus the textarea on mobile.
4.2 The only movement that should happen is the bar lifting to sit on top of the keyboard. The rest of the page content should stay where it is.
4.3 When the keyboard closes, the bar returns to the bottom of the page with no animation jank.
	5.	Spacing and wrapping
5.1 On mobile, long placeholder text in the textarea should wrap naturally without pushing the refresh icon or send button off screen.
5.2 The textarea should still auto-expand up to its max height as I type, but the vertical alignment of the row (refresh icon, textarea, counter, send button) should remain visually clean and centered.
5.3 The suggestion prompt chips above the bar should remain readable on mobile. Multiple rows of chips are fine. Do not reintroduce a box or card wrapper behind them.
	6.	Summary of intent
	•	Make the chat input bar feel balanced and aligned in one row.
	•	Remove mic and plus.
	•	Tighten bottom spacing so the bar feels like part of the footer.
	•	On mobile: bar sits just above the keyboard when focused, without jumping to the top, and it stops moving around once placed.
	•	If I scroll up while typing, the keyboard should dismiss and the bar should go back to resting at the page bottom.

Deliverables
	•	Update the JSX / TSX for the chat bar row (icons, textarea, counter, send button) with the new layout and alignment rules.
	•	Update the styling so everything in the row is vertically centered and the send button’s icon is visually centered inside its circle.
	•	Reduce the bottom padding so the bar feels like the bottom of the page.
	•	Refine the mobile keyboard handling logic to match the two-state behavior described.
	•	Keep prompt chips behavior and stacking, but do not wrap them in a big container and do not hide them unless a message was actually sent.
