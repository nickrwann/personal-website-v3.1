I'm an AI engineer with 5+ years of experience and more than 20 patents. I focus on building reliable, scalable systems that move from prototype to product without losing clarity or purpose. I work on retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, multi-agent systems, and internal AI platforms that help real teams get work done.

I like to learn new tech quickly and apply it to real problems, not just demos. Outside work I'm usually exploring the city, traveling, lifting, or hunting down the best latte in town.

## Experience

**Software Engineer II, OCTO Engineering, Dell Technologies** (2023–Present)  
I work on AI systems, distributed services, and internal enablement tools. I have shipped work across MLOps pipelines, ONNX Runtime optimization, and agent-style systems that automate complex internal workloads. A lot of my work has focused on retrieval-augmented generation and multi-agent platforms that help teams use AI effectively. I have contributed to more than 20 patents in AI and systems design.

**Software Engineer I, Client CTO Engineering, Dell Technologies** (2021–2023)  
I worked on on-device intelligence and connected device concepts. Projects ranged from telemetry automation for local model training to early input and design work for the NYX controller and related edge experiences. Some of that work started as fast proof-of-concept and ended up influencing product direction.

### Earlier work

**Software Engineering Intern, Tech Strategy Team, Dell Technologies** (2020)  
I helped develop a touchpad concept with hardware-level video conferencing controls, which later showed up in shipping Dell devices.

**Data Science Intern, ThoughtTrace** (2018)  
I helped automate training and validation for document classifiers on oil and gas lease data, focusing on dataset quality and retraining speed.

**Peer Teacher, Electrical Engineering, Texas A&M University** (2019)  
I taught computer systems fundamentals and supported lab instruction for undergrads.
